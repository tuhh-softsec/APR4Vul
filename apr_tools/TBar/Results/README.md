######  Update (2019-07-10):
Updates:
  * PerfectFL results: 
      * correct : 71, incorrect 30, precision: 71/(71+30)=70.3% 
  * NormalFL results: 
      * correct : 42, incorrect 39, precision: 42/(42+39)=51.9%
  * Explanation:
      * The patches of Chart-7 and Closure-4 should be classified as incorrect as they only partially fix the bugs but make the programs pass all test cases. The patch of Math-15 should be classified as incorrect as well, since its range is much bigger than the range of developer's patch. Thanks for the report of the report of Thibaud Lutellier from University of Waterloo.
