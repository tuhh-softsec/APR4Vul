     * As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>:
     * Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects.
     * How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't... 
     * Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.
     * In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.
     * <p>
     * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: 
     * dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)
     * However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.
     * <pre>
     *   // someMethod() must be safe (e.g. doesn't throw, doesn't have dependencies to the object state, etc.)
     *   // if it isn't safe then you will have trouble stubbing it using this api. Use Mockito.doCallRealMethod() instead. 
     *   when(mock.someMethod()).thenCallRealMethod();
     *   
     *   // calls real method:
     *   mock.someMethod();
     *   
     * </pre>
     * See also javadoc {@link Mockito#spy(Object)} to find out more about partial mocks. 
     * <b>Mockito.spy() is a recommended way of creating partial mocks.</b> 
     * The reason is it guarantees real methods are called against correctly constructed object because you're responsible for constructing the object passed to spy() method.
